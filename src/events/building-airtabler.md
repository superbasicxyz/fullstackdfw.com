Sometimes a service’s dominant library doesn’t make it easy to do what we need it to do – like query a bunch of records. James will discuss how he decided to develop a new API client for [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com) called [Airtabler](https://github.com/superbasicxyz/airtabler) and his experience with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

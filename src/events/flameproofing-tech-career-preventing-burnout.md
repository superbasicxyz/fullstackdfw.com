As software developers, burnout is a real risk that some consider inevitable. In order to prevent burnout, we can diligently practice self care and self advocacy and recognize that we have wide blind spots around our own needs.

After this talk, you will be able to:

- understand self care, self advocacy, and self soothing
- create boundaries that protect you from burnout
- prioritize actions that stabilize your core self care process
- identify realistic goals to establish flameproof habits

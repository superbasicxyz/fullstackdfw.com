No speaker this month.  We will talk about the year so far, the year ahead, and spitball on how we can make FSDFW a better resource for all of us.  Chris might share some live-streaming lessons learned.  He might even try routing [Lumen](https://lumen-app.com/) in via [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) in via [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/.)
